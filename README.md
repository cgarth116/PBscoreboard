# PBscoreboard

Software and hardware complex for the paintball tournament.

At the moment, a PC program is implemented, an LED information board in the field, radio buttons on banners with a choice of power type batteries\accumulators, duplication of part of the information from the screen of the referee informant on TV(main time\pit time\score\names of playing teams\presence of timeouts), in test mode, the statistics of matches are recorded.

Functionality:

- work in 2\4 pit's

- 8 event formats + 1 customizable (by match time)

- two voice-over options

- save extended match results to a file(result of each game + time).)

- filling in team names from the schedule file

- connection of radio buttons on banners (physically, you can connect more than one button to the transmitter, for example, by a button on the edges of the banner for the convenience of commands and less wear of equipment)

- connecting buttons in the pit's(in the process of hardware implementation)

- display of information on the central scoreboard and in the pit zones

- etc.

The program is constantly in the process of improvement(adding new functionality) so the use of "as it is"...
